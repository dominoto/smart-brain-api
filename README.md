# SmartBrain backend
Backend part of final project for _The Complete Web Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery_ course.

The point of the project is to make a React frontend, node.js backend and PostgreSQL database as a small full-stack app that uses [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/) API for face detection. It has:
+ login and registration pages
+ homescreen with URL input box for fetching the picture in which you want to detect a face
+ entries counter that counts how many times you searched for a face

How to use:
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Enter the details for your own database in `server.js`
